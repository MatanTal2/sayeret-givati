1. in the admin routs when we add CSV or just one personnal to the authorized_personnel we can't use - or ' for names
wqe need to support this chars
2. make sure we can handle multiple possibility to insert phone numbers
ignore not digits charas and multiple -  or spaces
3. in the admin panel we need the ability to update some fields in the authorized_personnel.
4. need to add IsRegisterd field to authorized_personnel.
5. ~~After successfully adding authorized_personnel in the admin panel, the UI shows a misleading cache message...~~
   - **OBSOLETE (2026-04-28):** `usePersonnelManagement` no longer calls `fetchPersonnel()` after mutations. It uses `PersonnelCache.appendToCache` / `updateInCache` / `removeFromCache` / `clearCache` to keep the cache in sync without re-fetching, so no cache-info message overwrites the success message. No fix required.
6. ~~Admin → AddPersonnel form gives no visible success/failure feedback after submit~~
   - **FIXED (2026-04-28):** `AddPersonnel.tsx` now drives a local `submitState` machine (`idle | submitting | success | error`). Submit button transitions through spinner → green check / red X and reverts after 3s. Status block below the button shows "נוסף בהצלחה" with name + military ID on success, or the backend error string under "הוספת כוח אדם נכשלה". Pattern mirrors `ProfileImageUpload`'s auto-dismiss. Hook contract change: `addPersonnel` now returns `PersonnelOperationResult` so consumers can drive their own UX.
7. `authorized_personnel.approvedRole` is typed as plain `string` and hardcoded to `'soldier'` in three places (`src/lib/adminUtils.ts:334, 358, 590`). It is never selectable in any of the admin forms — AddPersonnel, BulkUpload, and UpdatePersonnel all skip it. The field is meant to be the soldier's military role, the same value that lands in `FirestoreUserProfile.role` after registration.
   - **Why this matters:** `UserRole` enum already exists in `src/types/equipment.ts:177` (SOLDIER / TEAM_LEADER / SQUAD_LEADER / SERGEANT / OFFICER / COMMANDER / EQUIPMENT_MANAGER). Without admin selection, every pre-authorized soldier ships as a generic SOLDIER even when the unit knows they are a TL or sergeant up front. Equipment policy and report-request scoping both key off the registered user's role downstream — wrong default = wrong permissions on first login.
   - **Note:** do NOT confuse with `userType` (UserType: admin/system_manager/manager/team_leader/user) — that is the system access level and is already a dropdown in the admin forms. `approvedRole` is the military role and is a separate concept.
   - **Fix:**
     - Tighten the type: `approvedRole: UserRole` (not `string`) in `src/types/admin.ts:55` and `src/lib/db/server/authorizedPersonnelService.ts:17`.
     - Add a role dropdown (Headless UI Listbox per `feedback_ui_libs`) to AddPersonnel single-add form, BulkUpload (per-row column + a "default role for all rows" selector at the top), and UpdatePersonnel.
     - Default value remains `UserRole.SOLDIER` when admin doesn't pick.
     - Hebrew labels per `src/constants/text.ts` — add a `USER_ROLE_LABELS` map if one doesn't exist (check `src/constants/admin.ts` first).
     - CSV bulk upload: accept role in a new optional column; rows missing the value fall back to the default.
